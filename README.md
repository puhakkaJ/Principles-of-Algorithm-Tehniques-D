# Principles-of-Algorithms-Tehniques-D
This course will advance your understanding in the basic principles and fundamental challenges in computing.  We analyze problems, where we can rigorously argue that a certain algorithm design is good (or bad). The focus is on proving mathematically that certain approaches do (or do not) work. Furthermore, we learn mathematical principles that form the basis for a large number of algorithm designs and their analysis, as well as in select cases turn these into concrete algorithm implementations and measure their performance.
